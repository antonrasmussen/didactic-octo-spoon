Talking about windowing


MIT Built X to sit on Unix.... apple's initial GUI was built on X--> became OSX


X is getting old

Created as a graduate project one summer in the 90s



Windowing system sits on top of OS [Window Server] -> OS plays with Hardware

Virtual screen space: window within a window

Had problems dealing with user input

Look into visual surface determiniation for window appearance illusion... e.g. windows behind windows

Event system is interrupt driven.... 32 events
